  Great Britain,' are republished from 'The Leader' newspaper, and form a
  little Thesaurus of information of a peculiar and interesting
  character."&mdash;<i>Leeds Times.</i></p>

  <p>"These lively sketches of living political characters are, many of
  them, admirably written, always satirical in spirit, and occasionally
  far-seeing in their ken. There are points which Thackeray could hardly
  have done better."&mdash;<i>Era.</i></p>

  <p>"The readers of the 'Leader' need only be informed that the series of
  papers, 'The Governing Classes of Great Britain,' which were contributed
  by a Non-Elector, have been collected into an eighteenpenny volume, in
  handsome legible type; the Non-Elector declaring himself to be Mr. Edward
  Whitty, a name which has only the aspirate <i>de

<h3>MEMOIRS OF GRAMMONT.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. viii., pp. 461. 549.; Vol. ix., pp. 3. 204. 356.)</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Des gens qui écrivent pour le Comte de Grammont peuvent compter sur
  quelque indulgence."&mdash;Vide Introduction to the Memoirs.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Grammont's first visit to England may have been in Nov. 1655, when
  Bordeaux, the French ambassador, concluded a treaty with Cromwell,
  whereby France agreed totally to abandon the interests of Charles II.;
  and Cromwell, on his part, declared war against Spain, by which we gained
  Jamaica. Another opportunity occurred in 1657, when Cromwell's
  son-in-law, Lord Fauconberg, was sent to compliment Louis XIV. and
  Cardinal Mazarin, who were near Dunkirk. The ambassador presented some
  horses to the King and his brother, and also to the Cardinal. They made
  the ambassador handsome presents, and the King sent the Duke de Crequi as
  his ambassador extraordinary to the Protector, accompanied by several
  persons of distinction.</p>

  <p>Grammont was at the siege of Montmedi, which surrendered on the 6th
  August, 1657.</p>

  <p>He accompanied his brother, the Marshal, to Madrid in 1660, to demand
  the hand of the Infanta for his sovereign. On the Kings entry into Paris
  the same year with his Queen, Madame de Maintenon writes:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Chevalier de Grammont, Rouville, Bellefont, and some other
  courtiers, followed the household of Cardinal Mazarin, which surprised
  everybody: it was said it was out of flattery. The Chevalier was dressed
  in a flame-coloured suit, and was very brilliant."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In 1662 he was disgraced on account of Madlle de la Motte Houdancourt,
  aggravated also, it is said, by his having watched the King getting over
  the tiles into the apartments of the maids of honour, and spread the
  report about.</p>

  <p>The writer of the notes to the <i>Memoirs</i> supposes that the
  Count's circumstances were not very flourishing on his arrival in
  England, and that he endeavoured to support himself by his literary
  acquirements. A scarce little work in Latin and French on King Charles's
  coronation was attributed to him, the initials to which were P. D. C.,
  which it was said might stand for Philibert de Cramont. There seems no
  reason for this supposition: his finances were no worse in England than
  they had been in France; and there is no doubt he made his appearance at
  the Court of England under the greatest advantages. His family were
  specially protected by the Duke and Duchess of Orleans, the favourite
  sister of King Charles; and the Count was personally known to the King
  and to the Duke of York; and from a letter of Comminges', dated 20th Dec.
  1662, it may be almost inferred that the Duke sent his own yacht to fetch
  the Count to London. Bussi-Rabutin writes of the Count, that he wrote
  almost worse than any one, and therefore not very likely to recruit his
  finances by authorship.</p>

  <p>The exact date of Grammont's marriage has yet to be fixed: probably a
  search at Doctors' Commons for the licence, or in the Whitehall
  Registers, if such exist, would determine the day. The first child, a
  boy, was born on the 28th August, O. S., 7th September, 1664, but did not
  live long. This would indicate that the marriage took place in December,
  1663. From Comminges' letters, dated in that month, it must have been on
  a day subsequent to the 24th December. Their youngest child, who was
  afterwards an abbess, was born on the 27th December, 1667.</p>

  <p>It has been stated that Grammont was the hero of Molière's <i>Mariage
  forcée</i>, which was performed before the Court at Versailles in 1664.
  Comminges' letter of May 19-24, 1664, may allude to the Count's conduct
  to Miss Hamilton. He was twenty years older than the lady.</p>

  <p>Under date of October 24-November 3, 1664, Comminges announces the
  departure from London of the Count and Countess de Grammont.</p>

  <p>The Count was present with the King at the conquest of Franche Comte
  in 1660, and in particular at the siege of Dôle in February, 1668. The
  Count and Countess were subsequently in England, as King Charles himself
  writes to the Duchess of Orleans on the 24th October, 1669, that the
  Count and Countess, with their family, were returning to France by way of
  Dieppe.</p>

  <p>In 1668, according to St. Evremond, the Count was successful in
  procuring the recall of his nephew, the Count de Guiche.</p>

  <p>Evelyn mentions in his <i>Diary</i> dining on the 10th May, 1671, at
  Sir Thomas Clifford's, "where dined Monsieur de Grammont and several
  French noblemen."</p>

  <p>Madame de Sévigné names the Count in her letter of 5th January,
  1672.</p>

  <p>He was present at the siege of Maestricht, which surrendered to the
  King in person on the 29th June, 1673.</p>

  <p>Madame de Sévigné names the Count again in her letter of the 31st
  July, 1675.</p>

  <p>The Duchess of Orleans (the second) relates the great favour in which
  the Count was with the King.</p>

  <p>He was present at the sieges of Cambray and Namur in April, 1677, and
  February, 1678.</p>

  <p>We obtain many glimpses of the Count and Countess in subsequent years
  in the pages of Madame de Sévigné, Dangeau, and others, which may be
  consulted in preference to filling your columns with extracts. <!-- Page
  584 --><span class="pagenum" title="584.png"><a
  name="page584"></a>{584}</span></p>

  <p>In 1688, Grammont was sent by the Duke of Orleans to congratulate
  James II. on the birth of his son; in the <i>Ellis Correspondence</i>,
  under the date of 10th July, 1688, it appears there was to have been an
  exhibition of fire-works, but it was postponed, and the following
  intimation of the cause was hinted at by a person behind the scenes:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The young Prince is ill, but it is a secret; I think he will not
  hold. The foreign ministers, Zulestein and Grammont, stay to see the
  issue."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Grammont died on the 30th January, 1707, aged eighty-six years; his
  Countess survived him only until the 3rd June, 1708, when she expired,
  aged sixty-seven years. They only left one child, namely, Claude
  Charlotte, married on the 6th April, 1694, to Henry Howard, Earl of
  Stafford; Marie Elizabeth de Grammont, born the 27th December, 1667,
  Abbess of Sainte Marine de Poussey, in Lorraine, having died in 1706,
  previous to her parents.</p>

  <p>Maurepas says that Grammont's eldest daughter was maid of honour to
  the second Duchess of Orleans, who suspected her of intriguing with her
  son, afterwards the celebrated Regent. The Duchess, he adds, married her
  to Lord Stafford.</p>

  <p>Another writer says, that although Grammont's daughters were not
  handsome, yet they caused as much observation at Court as those who
  were.</p>

  <p>Count Hamilton is little to be trusted to in his chronology, from a
  mischievous custom that he has of, whenever he has to record a marriage
  or love affair between two parties considerably different in age, adding
  to that difference extravagantly, to make the thing more ridiculous. Sir
  John Denham is a well-known instance of this; but another, which is not
  noticed by the editor of Bohn's edition, nor any other that I have seen,
  is his making out Col. John Russell, a younger brother of the first Duke
  of Bedford, to have been seventy years of age in 1664, although his
  eldest brother was born in 1612, and the colonel could have been little
  older than, if as old as, De Grammont himself.</p>

<h3>BOHN'S REPRINT OF WOODFALL'S "JUNIUS."</h3>

  <p>When a publisher issues a series of such works as are comprised in
  <i>Bohn's Standard Library</i>, and thereby brings expensive publications
  within the reach of the multitude, he is entitled to the gratitude and
  the active support of the reading portion of the public; but, if he wish
  to be ranked amongst the respectable booksellers, he ought to see to the
  accuracy of his reprints. Bohn's edition of Woodfall's <i>Junius</i>, in
  two volumes, purports to contain "the entire work, as originally
  published." This it does not. Some of the notes are omitted; and the text
  is, in many instances, incorrect. I have examined the first volume only;
  and I shall state some of the errors which I have found, on comparing it
  with Woodfall's edition, three volumes 8vo., 1814. The pages noted are
  those of Bohn's first volume.</p>

  <p>P. 87. In his Dedication, Junius says: "If an honest, and, I may truly
  affirm, a laborious zeal." Bohn turns it into nonsense, by printing it:
  "If an honest <i>man</i>, and I may truly," &amp;c.</p>

  <p>P. 105. In Letter I., Junius speaks of "distributing the
  <i>offices</i> of state, by rotation." Bohn has it "<i>officers</i>."</p>

  <p>P. 113. In Letter II., Sir W. Draper says that "all Junius's
  <i>assertions</i> are false and scandalous." Bohn prints it
  "<i>exertions</i>."</p>

  <p>P. 206. In Letter XXII., Junius says, "it may be advisable to
  <i>gut</i> the resolution." Bohn has it "to <i>put</i>."</p>

  <p>P. 240. In Letter XXX., Junius says: "And, if possible, to perplex
  <i>us with</i> the multitude of their offences." Bohn omits the words
  "<i>us with</i>."</p>

  <p>P. 319. In Letter XLII., Junius speaks of the "future <i>projects</i>"
  of the ministry. Bohn prints it "future <i>prospects</i>."</p>

  <p>P. 322. In the same letter, Junius says: "How far people may be
  animated <i>to resistance</i>, under the present administration." Bohn
  omits "<i>to resistance</i>."</p>

  <p>P. 382. In Letter LIII., Horne says: "And in case of refusal,
  <i>threaten</i> to write them down." Bohn omits "<i>threaten</i>."</p>

  <p>P. 428. In Letter LXI., Philo-Junius says, "his view is to change a
  court of <i>common law into a court of</i> equity." Bohn omits the words
  "<i>common law into a court of</i>."</p>

  <p>P. 437. In Letter LXIII., Junius writes, "love <i>and kindness</i> to
  Lord Chatham." Bohn omits "<i>and kindness</i>."</p>

  <p>P. 439. In Letter LXIV., Junius speaks of "a multitude of
  <i>prerogative writs</i>." Bohn has it "a multitude of
  <i>prerogatives</i>."</p>

  <p>P. 446. In Letter LXVIII., Junius says to Lord Mansfield: "If, on your
  part, you should have no plain, substantial <i>defence</i>." Bohn
  substitutes "<i>evidence</i>" for "<i>defence</i>."</p>

  <p>These are the most important errors, but not all that I have found in
  the text. I now turn to the reprint of Dr. Mason Good's Preliminary
  Essay. The editor says: "The omission of a quotation or two, of no
  present interest, and the correction of a few inaccuracies of language,
  are the only alterations that have been made in the Preliminary Essay."
  We shall see how far this is true. Such alterations as "arrogance" for
  "insolence," p. 2.; "classic purity" for "classical chastity," p. 3.;
  "severe" for "atrocious," p. 15., I shall not particularise farther; but
  merely observe that, so far from being merely "corrections <!-- Page 585
  --><span class="pagenum" title="585.png"><a
  name="page585"></a>{585}</span>of inaccuracies of language," they are
  frequently changes of meaning.</p>

  <p>At pp. 4. and 5., extracts from speeches by Burke and North are
  introduced into the text. In Woodfall, they are given in a note, so as
  not to interrupt the writer's argument.</p>

  <p>Occasionally, a sentence is partly rewritten. I take one specimen. Dr.
  Good says that, "But for the Letters of Junius, the Commons of England
  might still ... have been exposed to the absurd and obnoxious harassment
  of parliamentary arrests, upon a violation of privileges undefined and
  incapable of being appealed against&mdash;defrauded of their estates upon
  an arbitrary and interested claim of the crown." In Bohn, p. 5., the
  words are altered to "have been exposed to arbitrary violations of
  individual liberty, under undefined pretexts of parliamentary privileges,
  against which there <i>were</i> (?) no appeal&mdash;defrauded of their
  estates upon capricious and interested claims of the crown."</p>

  <p>Dr. Good, to show that Burke could not be Junius, cites several
  passages from his works; and then proves, by quotations from Junius, that
  the opinions of the one were opposed to those of the other. In Bohn's
  edition all these quotations, which occupy twelve octavo pages in
  Woodfall, are omitted as unnecessary, although the writer's argument is
  partly founded upon them; and yet the editor has retained (evidently
  through carelessness), at p. 66., Dr. Good's subsequent reference to
  these very quotations, where, being about to give some extracts from
  General Lee's letters, he says: "They may be compared with those of
  Junius, <i>that follow the preceding extracts from Mr. Burke</i>." This
  reference is retained, but the extracts spoken of are omitted.</p>

  <p>Some of Woodfall's notes are wholly left out; but I will not lengthen
  these remarks by specially pointing them out. The new notes of Bohn's
  editor offer much matter for animadversion, but I confine myself to one
  point. In a note to Sir W. Draper's first letter (p. 116.), we are told
  that Sir William "married a Miss De Lancy, who died in 1778, <i>leaving
  him a daughter</i>." In another note relating to Sir William (p. 227.),
  it is stated that "he married a daughter of the second son of the Duke of
  St. Alban's. Her ladyship died in 1778, <i>leaving him no issue</i>." How
  are we to reconcile these statements?</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>Mutilating Books.</i>&mdash;Swift, in a letter to Stella, Jan. 16,
  1711, says, "I went to Bateman's the bookseller, and laid out
  eight-and-forty shillings for books. I bought three little volumes of
  Lucian in French, for our Stella." This Bateman would never allow any one
  to look into a book in his shop; and when asked the reason, he would say,
  "I suppose you may be a physician, or an author, and want some recipe or
  quotation; and if you buy it I will engage it to be perfect before you
  leave me, but not after; as I have suffered by leaves being torn out, and
  the books returned, to my very great loss and prejudice.</p>

  <p><i>Divinity Professorships.</i>&mdash;In the last number of <i>The
  Journal of Sacred Literature</i> (April, 1854), there is a well-deserved
  eulogium on the biblical labours of Dr. Kitto; who, though in the
  enjoyment of the title of D.D. (conferred on him some years ago by a
  Continental University), is nevertheless a layman, and not, as is very
  commonly imagined, in orders. The article, however, to which I refer,
  contains a curious mistake. Michaelis is cited (p. 122.) as an instance
  of a layman being able, on the Continent, to hold a professorship
  relating to theology and biblical science, in contrast to what is assumed
  to be the invariable system at the English Universities. It is true,
  indeed, that for the most part such professorships are here held by
  clergymen; but from several of them laymen are not excluded by any law.
  At Cambridge, the Norrisian Professor of Divinity, for example, may be a
  layman.</p>

  <p>With respect to the degree of D.D., it is observed by the Writer of
  the article, p. 127.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In Germany this degree is given to laymen, but in England it is
  exclusively appropriated to the clergy. This led to the very general
  impression among strangers, that Dr. Kitto is a clergyman."</p>

  <i>Lives of the Queens of England</i>, vol. vii. p. 202., and vol. viii.
  p. 352., edit. 1853, speaks of that worthy layman, Robert Nelson, both as
  a <i>Doctor</i> and a clergyman!&mdash;<span class="sc">Ed.</span>]</p>

<h3>SEPULCHRAL MONUMENTS.</h3>

<p class="ac">(<i>Concluded from</i> p. 539.)</p>

  <p>A divine, reasoning philosophically with a lady on the possibility of
  the appearance of ghosts, was much perplexed by her simple inquiry as to
  where the clothes came from. If then the mediæval effigies are alive, how
  can the costume be reconciled with their position? Where do their clothes
  come from? The theory advanced in the two preceding Numbers seems to
  offer a ready solution. Another corroborative fact remains to be stated,
  that when a kneeling attitude superseded the recumbent, the brasses were
  placed upon the wall, testifying, in some degree at least, that the
  horizontal figures were not traditionally regarded as living portraits.
  In anticipation of objections, it can only be said that "they have no
  speculation in their eyes;" that out of the thousands in existence, a few
  exceptions will only prove the rule; and that their incongruities were
  conventional.</p>

  <p>It is now my purpose to offer a few more reasons for releasing the
  sculptors of the present day from a rigid adherence to the uplifted hands
  and the straight head. That there is grace, dignity, and pious serenity
  occasionally perceptible in these interesting relics of bygone days,
  which so appropriately furnish our magnificent cathedrals, and embellish
  numbers of our parochial churches, is freely admitted; but that they are
  formal, conventional, monotonous, and consequently unfitted for modern
  imitation, cannot reasonably be denied by a person with pretensions to
  taste. From the study of anatomy, the improvement in painting, the
  invention of engraving, our acquaintance with the matchless works of
  Greece, and other causes, this branch of art has made considerable
  advance. Why, then, should a sculptor be now "cabin'd, cribb'd, confined,
  bound in," by such inflexible conditions? If some variation is
  discoverable in the ancient types, why should he not have the advantage
  of selection, and avail himself of that attitude best adapted to the
  situation of the tomb and the character of the deceased? Not to multiply
  examples of deviation&mdash;the Queen of Henry IV., in Canterbury
  Cathedral, has one arm reposing at her side, and the other upon her
  breast. The arms of Edward III., in Westminster Abbey, are both stretched
  at his side. An abbot of Peterborough, in that cathedral, holds a book
  and a pastoral staff. The hands of Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, in
  his beautiful chapel, are raised, but separate. Several have the arms
  crossed, expressive of humility and resignation. Others (lay as well as
  clerical) press a holy book to their bosom; and some place the right hand
  upon the heart, denoting the warmth of their love and faith. In his
  description of Italian monuments, Mr. Ruskin remarks, that "though in
  general, in tombs of this kind, the face of the statue is slightly turned
  towards the spectator, in one case it is turned away" (<i>Stones of
  Venice</i>, vol. iii. p. 14.); and instances are not unfrequent of
  similar inclinations of the head at home. Why then should this poor
  choice be denied? Why should he be fettered by austere taskmasters to
  this stereotyped treatment, to the proverbial stiffness of "our
  grandsires cut in alabaster." Indignation has been excited in many
  quarters against that retrograde movement termed "pre-Raphaelism," yet
  what in fact is this severe, angular, antiquated style, but identically
  the same thing in stone? What but pre-Angeloism? Upon the supposition
  that the effigies have departed this life, or even that the spirit is
  only about to take its flight, anatomical and physiological difficulties
  present themselves, for strong action would be required to hold the hands
  in this attitude of prayer. The drapery, too, hanging in straight folds,
  has been always apparently designed from upright figures, circumstances
  evincing how little the rules of propriety were then regarded. Their
  profusion occasions a familiarity which demands a change, for the range
  is here as confined as that of the sign-painter, who could only depict
  lions, and was therefore precluded from varying his signs, except by an
  alteration in the colour. Such is the yearning of taste for diversity,
  that in the equestrian procession on the frieze of the Parthenon, out of
  about ninety horses, not two are in the same attitude; yet to whatever
  extent our churches may be thronged with these sepulchral tombs, all must
  be, as it were, cast in the same mould, till by repetition their
  beauty</p>

  <p>It is evidently imitating the works of antiquity under a disadvantage,
  inasmuch as modern costume is far inferior in picturesque effect to the
  episcopal vestments, the romantic armour, and numerous elegant
  habiliments of an earlier day. Every lesser embellishment and minuteness
  of detail are regarded by an artist who has more enlarged views of his
  profession as foreign to the main design; yet the robes, millinery,
  jewellery, and accoutrements usually held a place with the carvers of
  that time of equal importance with the face, and engaged as large a share
  of their attention.</p>

  <p>The comparative easiness of execution forms another argument. Having
  received the simple commission for a monument (specifications are
  needless), the workmen (as may be imagined) fixes the armour of the
  defunct knight upon his table, places a mask moulded from nature on the
  helmet-pillow, fits on a pair of hands with which, like an <!-- Page 587
  --><span class="pagenum" title="587.png"><a
  name="page587"></a>{587}</span>assortment of gloves, his studio is
  provided, diligently applies his compasses to insure exact equality by
  means of a receipt, perchance imparts some devotional expression, and the
  work is ready to be transferred to stone.</p>

  <p>Mr. Petit, in the preface (page x.) to his <i>Architectural
  Studies</i>, after due praise, asserts&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"That no sculptor anxious to advance his own reputation and art will
  ever set up a mediæval statue as his model. He may acknowledge its
  merits, and learn much from a careful examination of it, but still he
  will not look up to its designer as his master and guide."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Again, the efforts of genius are cramped by such uncompromising terms.
  The feet must unavoidably be directed towards the east; still, whatever
  the situation of the tomb may chance to be, from whatever point it may be
  viewed, or whether the light may fall on this side or on that, no way of
  escape is open, and no ingenuity can be employed to grapple with the
  uncontrollable obstruction. Portrait painters can choose the position
  most favourable to the features, but the monumental sculptor of the
  nineteenth century may only exhibit what is generally shunned, the direct
  profile; the contour of the face, and the wide expanse of brow, which
  might probably give the most lively indications of intellectual power,
  amiability of disposition, and devout tranquillity of soul, must be
  sacrificed to this unbending law "which altereth not." Sculptors, we are
  told, should overcome difficulties; but here they are required to "strive
  with impossibilities, yea, get the better of them." Whether painted
  windows, or some other ornament, or a tomb alone in harmony with the
  architecture (the form and features of the individual being elsewhere
  preserved), may constitute a more desirable memorial, is a separate
  question, but as statues are only admissible in a recumbent posture, some
  little latitude must be allowed. Like our reformers in higher things, it
  behoves us to discard what is objectionable in art, while we cherish that
  which is to be admired. Instead of treading in the footsteps of those
  lofty spirits, we should endeavour to follow the same road. Fully
  appreciating their excellences, let us avoid the distorted drawing of
  their brilliant glass, their irregularities in architectural design, the
  irreverence of their carving, and the conventionalism of their monumental
  sculpture.</p>

  <p class="author">C. T.</p>

  <p>I agree with C. T. in thinking that the usual recumbent figure on
  mediæval tombs was intended to represent a dead body, and more
  particularly to represent the body as it had lain in state, or had been
  borne to the grave; and I will add one or two additional reasons for this
  opinion. In the description in Speed, of the intended monument of Henry
  VIII., taken from a MS. given to Speed by that industrious herald master,
  Charles Lancaster, the following direction occurs:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Item, upon the same basement shall be made two tombes of blacke
  touch, that is to say, on either side one, and upon the said tombes of
  blacke touch shall be made the image of the King and Queen, on both
  sides, not as death [dead], but as persons sleeping, because to shewe
  that famous princes leaving behind them great fame never doe die, and
  shall be in royall apparels after the antique manner."&mdash;Speed's
  <i>Hist. of Great Brit.</i>, p. 1037. ed. 1632.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The distinction here taken between a dead and a sleeping figure, and
  the reason assigned for the latter, show, I think, that at that time a
  recumbent figure generally was supposed to represent death. In a monument
  of Sir Roger Aston, at Cranford, Middlesex, in Lysons' <i>Environs of
  London</i>, the knight and his two wives are represented praying, and by
  the side of the knight <i>lies</i> the infant son who had died in his
  lifetime. In the monument of Pope Innocent VIII. (Pistolesi, <i>Il
  Vaticano</i>, vol. i. plate 63.), the Pope is in one part represented in
  a living action, and in another as lying on his tomb, and from the
  contrast which would thus be afforded between life and death, the latter
  representation seems to indicate death.</p>

  <p>The hands raised in prayer are accounted for by C. T. Open eyes, I
  think, may be intended to express, by their direction towards heaven, the
  hope in which the deceased died. This is suggested by the description of
  the funeral car of Henry V.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Preparations were made to convey the body of Henry from Rouen to
  England. It was placed within a car, on which reclined his figure made of
  boiled leather, elegantly painted. A rich crown of gold was on its head.
  The right hand held a sceptre, and the left a golden ball. <i>The face
  seemed to contemplate the heavens.</i>"&mdash;Turner's <i>Hist. of
  Eng.</i>, vol. ii. p. 465.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I must, however, add that on referring to Monstrelet, I doubt whether
  Turner does not go too far in this last particular. Monstrelet merely
  says, "le visage vers le ciel." (Monst. <i>Chron.</i> vol. i. 325. ed.
  1595.) Speed adds an additional circumstance: "The body (of this figure)
  was clothed with a purple roabe furred with ermine." From the mutilated
  state of the tomb it is impossible to say how far the recumbent effigy
  resembled this boiled figure, but it is evidently just such a
  representation of the king as might have been laid on his tomb, and so
  far it tends to support the opinion that the effigy on a tomb represents
  the deceased as he had lain in state, or was borne to and placed in his
  tomb, an opinion fully borne out by the agreement which, in some cases,
  has been found to exist between the effigy on a tomb and the body
  discovered within it, or between the effigy and the description of the
  body as it had lain in state. See the tombs of King <!-- Page 588
  --><span class="pagenum" title="588.png"><a
  name="page588"></a>{588}</span>John, Robert Lord Hungerford, and Henry
  II., in Stothard's <i>Monumental Effigies of Great Britain</i>, and the
  Introduction to that work.</p>

  <p>I think it is not irrelevant to remark that at a very early period a
  recumbent figure was sometimes placed on a tomb as in a state of death.
  The recumbent Etruscan figures generally represent a state of repose or
  of sensual enjoyment; but there is one given by Micali (<i>Monumenti
  inediti a Illustrazione degli Antichi Popoli Italiani</i>, Tav. 48. p.
  303.), which is, undoubtedly, that of a dead person. In his description
  of it, Micali says, "On the first view of it one would say it was a
  sepulchral monument of the Middle Ages, so greatly does it resemble one."
  Mrs. Gray, too (<i>Tour to the Sepulchres of Etruria</i>, p. 264.),
  mentions a sepulchral urn, "very large, with a woman robed, and with a
  dog upon it, exactly like an English monument of the Middle Ages." If it
  were not for the dog, I should suppose this to be the one given by
  Micali. Though it may be too much to suppose that this form of
  representation may have been not uncommon, and may have passed into early
  Christian monuments, the instance in Micali at least shows that the idea
  of representing a dead body on a tomb is a very ancient one. It may be
  added, perhaps, that it is an obvious one.</p>

  <p>Though the reasons for thinking that the ordinary mediæval figure
  represents death may not be conclusive, still that opinion is, I think,
  entitled to be looked upon as the more probable one, until some
  satisfactory reason is given why a <i>living</i> person should be
  represented outstretched, and lying on his back&mdash;a position, as it
  seems to me, more inconsistent with life than the open eyes and hands
  joined in prayer are with death. For too much weight is not to be
  attached to slight inconsistencies. These would probably be disregarded
  for the sake of expressing some favourite idea or sentiment. Thus, in the
  proposed monument of Henry VIII., though the king and queen are directed
  to be represented as living, their souls are to be represented in the
  hand of "the Father."</p>

  <p>In modern tombs the mediæval idea has been entirely departed from, and
  the recumbent position sometimes expresses neither death, nor even sleep,
  but simple repose, or contemplation, resignation, hope, &amp;c. If it is
  proper or desirable to express these or other sentiments in a recumbent
  figure, it seems unreasonable to exclude them for the sake of a rigid
  adherence to a form, of which the import is either obscure, or, if
  rightly conjectured, has, by the change of customs, become idle and
  unmeaning.</p>

<h3>CRANMER'S MARTYRDOM.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix., pp. 392. 547.)</p>

  <p>I thank G. W. R. for his courteous remarks on my note on Cranmer.
  Perhaps I have overstated the effect of pain on the nervous system;
  certainly I was wrong in making a wider assertion than was required by my
  case, which is, that no man could hold his hand over unconfined flame
  till it was "entirely consumed" or "burnt to a coal." "Bruslée à feu de
  souphre" does not go so far as that, nor is it said at what time of the
  burning Ravaillac raised his head to look at his hand.</p>

  <p>J. H. has mistaken my intention. I have always carefully avoided
  everything which tended to religious or moral controversy in "N. &amp;
  Q." I treated Cranmer's case on physiological grounds only. I did not
  look for "cotemporaneous evidence against that usually received," any
  more than I should for such evidence that St. Denis did not walk from
  Paris to Montmartre with his head in his hand. If either case is called a
  miracle, I have nothing to say upon it <i>here</i>; and for the same
  reason that I avoid such discussion, I add, that in not noticing J. H.'s
  opinions on Cranmer, I must not be understood as assenting to or
  differing from them. J. H. says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It would surely be easy to produce facts of almost every week from
  the evidence given in coroners' inquests, in which persons have had their
  limbs burnt off&mdash;to say nothing of farther injury&mdash;without the
  shock producing death."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>If favoured with one such fact, I will do my best to inquire into it.
  None such has fallen within my observation or reading.</p>

  <p>The heart remaining "entire and unconsumed among the ashes," is a
  minor point. It does not seem impossible to J. H., "in its plain and
  obvious meaning." Do the words admit two meanings? Burnet says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"But it was no small matter of astonishment to find his heart entire,
  and not consumed among the ashes; which, though the reformed would not
  carry so far as to make a miracle of it, and a clear proof that his heart

  <p>Permit me to offer to H. B. C.'s consideration the case of Mutius
  Scævola, who, failing in his attempt to kill Porsenna in his own camp,
  and being taken before the king, thrust his right hand into the fire, and
  held it there until burnt; at the same time declaring that he knew three
  hundred men who would not flinch from doing the same thing. To a certain
  extent, I am inclined to think with <span class="sc">Alfred Gatty</span>
  (Vol. ix., p. 246.), "that an exalted state of feeling may be attained;"
  which, though it will not render the religious or political martyr
  insensible to pain, it will yet nerve him to go through his martyrdom
  without demonstration of extreme suffering.</p>

  <p>This ability to endure pain may be accounted for in either of the
  following ways:</p>

  <p>1. An exalted state of feeling; instance Joan of Arc.</p>

  <p>2. Fortitude; instance Mutius Scævola.</p>

  <p>3. Nervous insensibility; which carries the vanquished American Indian
  through the most exquisite tortures, and enables him to fall asleep on
  the least respite of his agony.</p>

  <p>Should these three be united in one individual, it is needless to say
  that he could undergo any bodily pain without a murmur.</p>

<h3>COLERIDGE'S UNPUBLISHED MANUSCRIPTS.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix., pp. 496. 543.)</p>

  <p>Every admirer of Coleridge's writings must feel, as I do, grateful to
  <span class="sc">Mr. Green</span> for the detailed account he has
  rendered of the manuscripts committed to his care. A few points, however,
  in his reply call for a rejoinder on my part. I will be as brief as
  possible.</p>

  <p>I never doubted for an instant that, had I "sought a private
  explanation of the matters" comprised in my Note, <span class="sc">Mr.
  Green</span> would have courteously responded to the application. This is
  just what I did <i>not</i> want: a public explanation was what I desired.
  "N. &amp; Q." (Vol. iv., p. 411.; Vol. vi., p. 533.; Vol. viii., p. 43.)
  will bear witness to the fact that the public required to know the reason
  why works of Coleridge, presumed to exist in manuscript, were still
  withheld from publication: and I utterly deny the justice of <span
  class="sc">Mr. Green</span>'s allegation, that because I have
  <i>explicitly</i> stated the charge <i>implied</i> by Mr. Alsop (the
  editor of <i>Letters, Conversations, and Recollections of Coleridge</i>)
  in his strictures, I have made an inconsiderate, not to say a coarse,
  attack upon him (<span class="sc">Mr. Green</span>). When a long series
  of appeals to the fortunate possessor of the Coleridge manuscripts
  (whoever he might turn out to be) had been met with silent indifference,
  I felt that the time was come to address an appeal personally to <span
  class="sc">Mr. Green</span> himself. That he has acted with the
  approbation of Coleridge's family, nobody can doubt; for the public
  (thanks to Mr. Alsop) know too well how little the greatest of modern
  philosophers was indebted to that family in his lifetime, to attach much
  importance to their approbation or disapprobation.</p>

  <p>No believer in the philosophy of Coleridge can look with greater
  anxiety than I do for the forthcoming work of <span class="sc">Mr.
  Green</span>. That the pupil of Coleridge, and the author of <i>Vital
  Dynamics</i>, will worthily acquit himself in this great field, who can
  question? But I, for one, must enter my protest against the publication
  of <span class="sc">Mr. Green</span>'s book being made the pretext of
  depriving the public of their right (may I say?) to the perusal of such
  works as do exist in manuscript, finished or unfinished. Again I beg most
  respectfully to urge on <span class="sc">Mr. Green</span> the expediency,
  not to say paramount duty, of his giving to the world <i>intact</i> the
  <i>Logic</i> (consisting of the <i>Canon</i> and other parts), the
  <i>Cosmogony</i>, and, as far as possible, the <i>History of
  Philosophy</i>. If his plea, that these works are not in a finished
  state, had been heretofore held good in bar of publication, we should
  probably have lost the inestimable privilege of reading and possessing
  those fragmentary works of the great philosopher which have already been
  made public.</p>

<h3>LIFE.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., pp. 429. 560. 608.; Vol. viii., pp. 43. 550.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent H. C. K. (Vol. vii., 560.) quotes a passage from
  Sir Thomas Browne's <i>Religio Medici</i>, sect. xlii. The following
  passage from the same writer's <i>Christian Morals</i> is much more to
  the point:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"When the Stoic said ('Vitam nemo acciperet, si daretur
  scientibus'&mdash;<i>Seneca</i>) that life would not be accepted if it
  were offered unto such as knew it, he spoke too meanly of that state of
  being which placeth us in the form of men. It more depreciates the value
  of this life, that <i>men would not live it over again</i>; for although
  they would still live on, yet <i>few or none can endure to think of being
  twice the same men upon earth, and some had rather never have lived than
  to tread over their days once more</i>. Cicero, in a prosperous state,
  had not the patience to think of beginning in a cradle again. ('Si quis
  Deus mihi largiatur, ut repuerascam et in cunis vagiam, valdè
  recusem.'&mdash;<i>De Senectute.</i>) Job would not only curse the day of
  his nativity, but also of his renascency, if he were to act over his
  disasters and the miseries of the dunghill. But the greatest underweening
  of this life is to undervalue that unto which this is but exordial, or a
  passage leading unto it. The great advantage of this mean life is thereby
  to stand in a capacity of a better; for the colonies of heaven must be
  drawn from earth, and the sons of the first Adam are only heirs unto the
  second. Thus Adam came into this world with the power also of another;
  not only to replenish the earth, but the everlasting mansions of
  heaven."&mdash;Part <span class="sm">III.</span> sect. xxv.</p>

</blockquote>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Looking back we see the dreadful train</p>
      <p>Of woes anew, which, were we to sustain,</p>
      <p>We should refuse to tread the path again."</p>
      <p class="i8">Prior's <i>Solomon</i>, b. iii.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The crown is won by the cross, the victor's wreath in the battle of
  life:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This is the condition of the battle<a name="footnotetag9"
  href="#footnote9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> which man that is born upon the
  earth shall fight. That if he be overcome he shall suffer as thou hast
  said, but if he get the victory, he shall receive the thing that I
  say."&mdash;2 <i>Esdr.</i> vii. 57.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Our grade in the other world is determined by our probation here. To
  use a simile of Asgill's, this life of time is a university in which we
  take our degree for eternity. Heaven is a pyramid, or ever-ascending
  scale; the world of evil is an inverted pyramid, or ever-descending
  scale. Life is motion. There is no such thing as stagnation: everything
  is either advancing or retrograding. Corruption itself is an activity,
  and evil is ever growing. According to the <i>habits</i> formed within
  us, we are ascending or descending; we cannot stand still.</p>

  <p>A man, then, in whom the higher life predominates, were he to live
  life over again, would <!-- Page 592 --><span class="pagenum" title="592.png"
  ><a name="page592"></a>{592}</span>grow from grace to grace, and his
  status in the spirit world would be higher than in the first life, and
  <i>vice versâ</i>; an evil man<a name="footnotetag10"
  href="#footnote10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> would be more completely evil, and
  would rank in a darker and more bestial form. They who hear not the good
  tidings will not be persuaded though one rose from the dead; and those
  with whom the experience of one life failed would not repent in the
  second.</p>

  <p>The testimony of the Shunamite's son, Lazarus, and of those who rose
  from the dead at the crucifixion, is not recorded; but they who have
  escaped from the jaws of death, by recovery from sickness or preservation
  from danger, may in a certain sense be said to live life over again.
  After the fright is over the warning in most cases loses its influence,
  and we have a verification of the two proverbs, "Out of sight out of
  mind," and&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The devil was sick, the devil a monk would be;</p>
      <p>The devil was well, the devil a monk would he."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In a word, this experiment of a second life would best succeed with
  him whose habits are formed for good, and whose life is already
  overshadowed by the divine life. Even of such an one it might be said,
  "Man is frail, the battle is sore, and the flesh is weak; even a good man
  may fall and become a castaway." The most unceasing circumspection is
  ever requisite. The most polished steel rusts in this corrosive
  atmosphere, and purest metals get discoloured.</p>

  <p>Finally, it is very probable that God gives every man a complete
  probation; that is to say, He cuts not man's thread of life till he be at
  the same side of the line he should be were he to live myriads of years.
  Every man is made up of a mixture of good and evil: these two principles
  never become soluble together, but ever tend each to eliminate the other.
  They hurry on in circles, alternately intersecting and gaining the
  ascendancy, till one is at last precipitated to the bottom, and pure good
  or evil remains. In the nature of things there are critical moments and
  tides of circumstances which become turning-points when time merges into
  eternity and mutability into permanence: and such a crisis may occur in
  the course of a short life as well as in many lives lived over again.</p>

<h3>INSCRIPTIONS ON BELLS.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix., p. 109.)</p>

  <p><i>St. Nicholas Church, Sidmouth.</i>&mdash;Having, on October 21,
  1850, taken intaglios in pressing-wax of the inscription forwarded by
  <span class="sc">Mr. Gordon</span>, from which plaster casts were made,
  the writer is able to speak of it with some degree of confidence. The
  inscription, however, is not peculiar to Sidmouth: it is found at other
  places in the county of Devon, and perhaps elsewhere. In Harvey's
  <i>Sidmouth Directory</i> for March, 1851, there is an article
  descriptive of all the six bells at this place, in which there is a
  fac-simile, engraved on wood, of the inscription in question. The words
  run all round the bell; and each word is placed on a cartouche. The Rev.
  Dr. Oliver of Exeter, in his communication to the writer on this subject,
  calls the bell the "Jesus Bell." The <i>Directory</i> observes:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It was formerly the practice to christen bells with ceremonies
  similar to, but even more solemn than, those attending the naming of
  children; and they were frequently dedicated to Christ (as this is), to
  the Virgin, or some saint."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Dr. Oliver to the writer says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I have met with it at Whitstone, near this city [Exeter], at East
  Teignmouth, &amp;c.; <i>michi</i> for <i>mihi</i>; <img
  src="images/ies_bl.png" class="middle" style="height:2.5ex;" alt="ihc (black-letter)" title="ihc (black-letter)"
  />, the abbreviation for Jesus. Very often the word <i>veneratum</i>
  occurs instead of <i>amatum</i>, and <i>illud</i> instead of
  <i>istud</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The <img src="images/ies_bl.png" class="middle" style="height:2.5ex;" alt="ihc (black-letter)" title="ihc (black-letter)"
  /> stands thus: <span class="over">i</span>h<span class="over">c</span>.
  The <i>Directory</i>, on this abbreviated word, remarks,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The <span class="sm">IHS</span>, as an abbreviation for Jesus, is a
  blunder. Casley, in his <i>Catalogue of the King's MSS.</i>, observes, p.
  23., that 'in Latin MSS. the Greek letters of the word Christus, as also
  Jesus, are always retained, except that the terminations are changed
  according to the Latin language. Jesus is written <span class="sc"><span
  class="over">IHS</span></span>, or in small characters ihs, which is the
  Greek <span class="over"><span title="IÊS" class="grk"
  >&Iota;&Eta;&Sigma;</span></span> or <span class="over"><span title="iês" class="grk"
  >&iota;&eta;&sigmaf;</span></span>, an abbreviation for <span
  title="iêsous" class="grk"
  >&iota;&eta;&sigma;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;</span>. However, the
  scribes knew nothing of this for a thousand years before the invention of
  printing, for if they had they would not have written <span
  class="over">ihs</span> for <span title="iêsous" class="grk"
  >&iota;&eta;&sigma;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;</span>; but they ignorantly
  copied after one another such letters as they found put for these words.
  Nay, at length they pretended to find <i>Jesus Hominum Salvator</i>
  comprehended in the word <span class="sc"><span
  class="over">IHS</span></span>, which is another proof that they took the
  middle letter for <i>h</i>, not <span class="grk">&eta;</span>. The dash
  also over the word, which is a sign of abbreviation, some have changed to
  the sign of the cross' [Hone's <i>Mysteries</i>, p. 282.]. The old way of
  <!-- Page 593 --><span class="pagenum" title="593.png"><a
  name="page593"></a>{593}</span>spelling Jhesus with an <i>h</i> may
  perhaps be referred to the same mistake. The inscription, then, runs
  thus:</p>

<p class="ac"><img src="images/estmihi.png" class="middle" style="height:2.5ex;" alt="Est mihi collatum Jesus istud nomen amatum" title="Est mihi collatum Jesus istud nomen amatum" />,</p>

  <p>which may be rendered, Jesus, that beloved name, is given to me. The
  bell bears no date, but is of course older than the period of the
  Reformation. But it remains to be observed that the last letter of the
  three is not an <i>s</i> but a <i>c</i>. It seems that in the old Greek
  inscriptions the substitution of the <i>c</i> for the <i>s</i> was
  common. Several examples are given in Horne's Introduction, vol. ii. pt.
  1. ch. iii. sect. 2., but we have not room to quote them. Suffice it to
  say that at p. 100., in speaking of the MSS. of the Codex Vaticanus, he
  says, 'The abbreviations are few, being confined chiefly to those words
  which are in general abbreviated, such as <span class="over scac"><span
  class="grk">&theta;</span>C</span>, <span class="over scac">KC</span>,
  <span class="over scac">IC</span>, <span class="over scac">XC</span>, for
  <span title="Theos" class="grk">&Theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>,
  <span title="Kurios" class="grk"
  >&Kappa;&upsilon;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, <span
  title="Iêsous" class="grk"
  >&Iota;&eta;&sigma;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;</span>, <span
  title="Christos" class="grk"
  >&Chi;&rho;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, <i>God</i>,
  <i>Lord</i>, <i>Jesus</i>, <i>Christ</i>.' At the end of these words, in
  the abbreviations, the <i>c</i> is used for the
  <i>s</i>.&mdash;<i>Peter.</i>"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This fourth bell is the oldest in the tower. The third, dated 1667,
  has quite a modern appearance as compared with it. The second, fifth, and
  sixth are all dated 1708, and the first, or smallest, was added in
  1824.</p>

  <p>Bromsgrove, Worcestershire. Ten bells; the inscriptions on two are as
  follows, the rest merely bearing the names of churchwardens, &amp;c.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>5. "God prosper the parish. A. R. 1701."</p>

      <p><span class="hid">10. "</span>And to the grave do summon all. 1773."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The latter seems to be a favourite inscription. The <span

  a bell in one of the Oxfordshire churches.</p>

  <p>Fotheringay, Northamptonshire. Four bells:</p>

  <div class="poem">

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>2. "Domini laudem, 1614, non verbo sed voce resonabo."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The two others respectively bear the dates 1609, 1595, with the
  initials of the rector and churchwarden, and (on the fourth bell) the
  words "Praise God." On a recent visit to this church I copied the
  following inscription from a bell, which, being cracked, is no longer
  used, and is now placed within the nave of the church. This bell is not
  mentioned by Archdeacon Bonney in his <i>Historic Notices of
  Fotheringay</i>, though he gives the inscriptions on the four others.</p>

  <p>At Bedale, in Yorkshire, is a bell weighing by estimation twenty-six
  hundredweight, which is probably of the same date, or nearly so, as the
  Dyrham bell. It measures four feet two inches and a half across the lip,
  and has the following inscription round the crown:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<img src="images/maltesex.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex;" alt="+" title="+"

  <p>The letters P. S., on the second bell, are the initials of Dr. Peter

  Bedale.</p>

  <p>On the fly-leaf of one of the later registers at Hornby, near Bedale,

  <p>This bell was given to the parish church of Hornby by the Lord Conyers

  <p>The legend noted from a bell at Sidmouth (Vol. ix., p. 109.),

  <div class="poem">

      <p class="hg3">"Est michi collatum</p>
      <p>Ihc istud nomen amatum,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>is not an unusual inscription on mediæval black-letter bells, if I may
  use the expression. The characters are small. It is on two bells at
  Teignmouth, and is on one of the bells in this tower:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>1. "<img src="images/maltesex.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex;" alt="+" title="+" /> Voce mea viva depello cuncta nociva."</p>

  </div>

  <p>A correspondent, <span class="sc">Mr. W. S. Simpson</span> (Vol.
  viii., p. 448.), asks the date of the earliest known examples of
  bells.</p>

  <p>Dates on mediæval bells are, I believe, very rare in England. I have
  but few notes of any. My impression is that such bells are as old as the
  towers which contain them, judging from the character of the letter, the
  wear and tear of the iron work, aye, of the bell itself. Many old bells
  have been recast, and on <i>such</i> there is often a record of the date
  of its prototype. For instance, at St. Peter's, Exeter:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Ex dono Petri Courtenay," &amp;c., "1484;" "renovat," &amp;c., "1676."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>At Chester-le-Street:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Thomas Langley dedit," &amp;c., "1409;" "refounded," &amp;c., "1665."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>I will add two or three with dates.</p>

  <p>In the Church of St. John Lateran was a bell with a mutilated
  inscription; but the date is plain, 1389. The name of Boniface IX. is on
  it, who was Sum. Pont. in that year.</p>

  <p>In the Church of St. Mariæ Majoris were two bells dated anno Dom.
  1285; and another 1291.</p>

  <p>In the Church of the Jesuits was a bell with this inscription, brought
  from England:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Facta fuit A. Dom. 1400, Die vi M&#x113;sis Sept&#x113;bris.</p>
      <p class="i5">Sancta Barbara, ora pro nobis."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Roccha, who published his <i>Commentary</i> 1612, says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In multis Campanis <i>fit mentio de Anno, in quo facta est
  Campana</i>, necnon de ipsius Ecclesiæ Rectore, vel optime merito, et

  Ecclesiarum, et Basilicarum inscriptiones Campanis incisas
  perlegi."&mdash;P. 55.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>So that it would appear that the practice of inscribing dates on bells
  was usual on the Continent, though for some reason or other it did not
  generally obtain in England till after the Reformation. I have a Note of
  another foreign bell or two with an early date.</p>

<h3>DE BEAUVOIR PEDIGREE.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix., p. 349.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent <span class="sc">Mr. Thomas Russell Potter</span>
  inquires whether any descendants of the De Beauvoirs of Guernsey are
  still existing. The family was, at one time, so numerous in that island
  that there are few of the gentry who cannot claim a De Beauvoir among
  their ancestors; but the name itself became extinct there by the death of
  Osmond de Beauvoir, Esq., in 1810. Some few years later, the last of a
  branch of the family settled in England died, leaving a very large
  property, which was inherited by a Mr. Benyon, who assumed the name of De
  Beauvoir.</p>

  <p>The name is also to be found in the Irish baronetcy; a baronet of the
  name of Brown having married the daughter and heiress of the Rev. Peter
  de Beauvoir, the widow I believe of an Admiral M&lsquo;Dougal, and
  thereupon taking up his wife's maiden name.</p>

  <p>With respect to the pedigree which <span class="sc">Mr. Potter</span>
  quotes, and of which many copies exist in this island, it is without
  doubt one of the most impudent forgeries in that way ever perpetrated.
  From internal evidence, it was drawn up at the latter end of the reign of
  Elizabeth, or at the beginning <!-- Page 597 --><span class="pagenum" title="597.png"
  ><a name="page597"></a>{597}</span>of the reign of James I., as the
  compiler speaks of Roger, Earl of Rutland, as being living. This nobleman
  succeeded to the title in 1588, and died in 1612. The pedigree ends in
  the Guernsey line with Henry de Beauvoir; whom we may therefore presume
  to have been still alive, or but recently deceased; and whose
  great-grandfather, according to the pedigree, was the first of the name
  in the island. Allowing three generations to a century, this would throw
  back the arrival of the first of the De Beauvoirs to some part of the
  sixteenth century; but we have proof that they were settled here long
  before that time. In an authentic document, preserved among the records
  of the island, the extent of the crown revenues drawn up by order of
  Edward III. in 1331, the names of Pierre and Guillaume de Beauvoir are
  found. Another Pierre de Beauvoir, apparently the great-grandson of the
  above-mentioned Pierre, was Bailiff of Guernsey from 1470 to 1480. As for
  the family of Harryes, no such I believe ever existed in Guernsey; but a
  gentleman of the name of Peter Henry, belonging to a family of very
  ancient standing in the island, bought property in Salisbury in the year
  1551, where the name seems to have been Anglicised to Harrys or Harris;
  as the name of his son Andrew, who was a jurat of the Royal Court of
  Guernsey, appears as often on the records of the island in the one form
  as in the other. One of Peter Henry's or Harris's daughters was married
  at Salisbury to a Henry de Beauvoir; and I have no doubt this is the
  marriage with which the pedigree ends. If I am right, the Harryes'
  pedigree has no more claim to authenticity than the De Beauvoir. If <span
  class="sc">Mr. Potter</span> wishes for farther information, and will
  communicate with me, I shall be happy to answer his inquiries as far as I
  am able.</p>

  <p>The pedigree itself, however, suggests two or three Queries which I
  should like to see answered.</p>

  <p>The heading is signed Hamlet Sankye or Saukye. Is anything known of
  such a person?</p>

  <p>The pedigree speaks of Sir Robert de Beauveir of Tarwell, Knt., <i>now
  living</i>. Was there ever a family of the name of De Beauveir, De
  Beauvoir, or Beaver, of Tarwell, in Nottinghamshire? And if there was,
  what arms did they bear?</p>

  <p>If there was such a family, was it in any way connected with any of
  the early proprietors of Belvoir Castle?</p>

  <p>Is anything known of a family of the name of Harryes or Harris of
  Orton, and what were their arms?</p>

<h3>RIGHT OF REFUGE IN THE CHURCH PORCH.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix., p. 325.)</p>

  <p>The following entry appears in a Corporation Book of this city, under
  the year 1662:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Thomas Corbold, who hath a loathesome disease, have, with his wife
  and two children, layne in the Porch of St. Peters per Mountegate above
  one year; it is now ordered by the Court that he be put into some place
  in the Pest-houses during the pleasure of the Court, untill the
  Lazar-houses be repaired."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>How they were supported during the year does not appear, or if he
  belonged to the parish; nor is it said that it was considered he gained
  settlement on the parish by continuing in the porch one year.</p>

  <p>I have heard of similar instances under an idea that any person may
  lodge in a church porch, and are not removable; but I believe it is an
  erroneous idea.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Goddard Johnson.</span></p>

  <p>In proof of the idea being current among the lower orders, that the
  church porch is a place of refuge for any houseless parishioners, I beg
  to state that a poor woman of the adjoining parish of Langford, came the
  other day to ask whether I, as a magistrate, could render her any
  assistance, as, in consequence of her husband's father and mother having
  gone to America, she and her family had become houseless, and were
  obliged to take up their abode in the church porch.</p>

  <p class="author">A. S.</p>

  <p class="address">West Tofts Rectory, Brandon, Norfolk.</p>

  <p>I know an instance where a person found a temporary, but at the same
  time an involuntary, home in a church porch. There was a dispute between
  the parishes of Frodingham and Broughton, co. Lincoln, some twelve months
  ago, as to the settlement of an old woman. She had been living for some
  time in, and had become chargeable to the latter parish, but was said to
  belong to the former. By some means or other the woman's son was induced
  to convey his mother to the parish of Frodingham, which he did; and as he
  knew quite well that the overseer of the parish would not receive her at
  his hands, he adopted the somewhat strange course of leaving her in the
  church porch, where she remained until evening, when the overseer of
  Frodingham took her away, fearing that her life might be in danger from
  exposure to the cold, she being far advanced in years. Until I saw <span
  class="sc">Cheverells'</span> Query, I thought the depository of the old
  woman in the church porch was, so far as the <i>place</i> of deposit was
  concerned, more accidental than designed; but after all it may be the
  remnant of some such custom as that of which he speaks, and I, for one,
  should be glad to see farther inquiry made into it. To which of J. H.
  Parker's <i>Parochial Tales</i> does <span class="sc">Cheverells</span>
  allude?</p>

<h3>FERDINAND CHARLES III., DUKE OF PARMA.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix., p. 417.)</p>

  <p>The late Duke of Parma was not the first lineal representative of the
  Stuarts, as stated by E. S. S. W. Victor Emanuel, King of Sardinia, who
  succeeded in 1802, left by his wife Maria Theresa of Austria four
  daughters. The eldest of these four, Beatrix, born in 1792, married, in
  1812, Francis IV., Duke of Modena, and by him (who died on the 21st of
  January, 1846) had issue two sons and two daughters. The eldest of these
  sons, Francis V., the present reigning Duke of Modena, is therefore the
  person who would be now sitting on the English throne had the Stuarts
  kept the succession. He has no children, I believe, by his wife Adelgonda
  of Bavaria; and the next person in succession would therefore be
  Dorothea, the infant daughter of his deceased brother Victor.</p>

  <p>Victor Emanuel's <i>second</i> daughter was Maria Theresa, who married
  Charles Duke of Parma, as stated by E. S. S. W.</p>

  <p>The present Countess of Chambord is Maria Theresa Beatrice-Gaëtana,
  the eldest of the two sisters of Francis V., Duke of Modena. She is
  therefore wife of the representative of the House of Bourbon, and sister
  to the representative of the House of Stuart.</p>

  <p class="author">S. L. P.</p>

  <p class="address">Oxford and Cambridge Club.</p>

  <p>Allow me to correct the statement made by your correspondent, that the
  Duke of Parma represented the Royal House of Stuart. The mother of the
  late Duke of Parma had an elder sister, Maria Beatrice, who married
  Francis IV., late Duke of Modena, and upon her death, in 1840, the
  <i>representation</i> devolved upon her son, Francis V., the present Duke
  of Modena, who was born in 1819.</p>

  <p class="author">P. V.</p>

  <p>Allow me to remark on the article of E. S. S. W. (Vol. ix., p. 417.)
  respecting the House of Stuart, that he is in error in assigning that
  honour to the late Duke of Parma, and, as a consequence, to his infant
  son and successor, Robert, now Duke of Parma. The late Duke was
  undoubtedly a descendant of Charles I. through his mother; but his mother
  had an <i>elder</i> sister, Beatrice, late Duchess of Modena, whose son,
  Francis V., now Duke of Modena, born 1st June, 1819, is the
  unquestionable heir to the House of Stuart, and, as a Jacobite would say,
  if any such curiosity there be in existence, legitimate King of Great
  Britain and Ireland.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Mr. Townsend's Wax-paper Process.</i>&mdash;At the last meeting of
  the Photographic Society a paper was read by Mr. Townsend, giving the
  results of a series of experiments instituted by him in reference to the
  wax-paper process. One of the great objections hitherto made to this
  process has been its slowness, as compared with the original calotype
  process, and its various modifications; and another, that its preparation
  involved some complexity of manipulation. Mr. Townsend has simplified the
  process materially, having found that the use of the fluoride and cyanide
  of potassium, as directed by Le Gray, in no way adds to the efficiency of
  the process, either in accelerating or otherwise. The iodide and bromide
  of potassium with free iodine give a paper which produces rapid, sure,
  and clean results. He discards whey, sugar of milk, grape sugar, &amp;c.,
  hitherto deemed essential, but which his experience shows to be
  unnecessary. He exhibited three negatives of the same view taken
  consecutively at eight o'clock in the morning, with the respective
  exposures of thirty seconds, two and a half minutes, and ten minutes,
  each of which was good and perfect. The formula he adopts is:</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td> Iodide of potassium</td>
<td class="ar pr025"> 600</td>
<td class="ac"> grs.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="pr2"> Bromide of potassium, from</td>
<td class="ar pr025"> 150 to 250</td>
<td class="ac"> "</td></tr>
<tr><td> Re-sublimed iodine</td>
<td class="ar pr025"> 6</td>
<td class="ac"> "</td></tr>
<tr><td> Distilled water</td>
<td class="ar pr025"> 40</td>
<td class="ac"> oz.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>The waxed papers are wholly immersed in this solution, and left to
  soak at least two hours, and are then hung to dry in the usual way. The
  papers are made sensitive by wholly immersing them in aceto-nitrate of
  silver of the following proportions:</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td style="width:15em"> Nitrate of silver</td>
<td class="ar pr025"> 30</td>
<td> grs.</td></tr>
<tr><td> Acetic acid</td>
<td class="ar pr025"> 30</td>
<td> minims.</td></tr>
<tr><td> Distilled water</td>
<td class="ar pr025"> 1</td>
<td> oz.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>The papers remaining in this solution not less than eight minutes.
  They are washed in two waters for eight minutes each, and then blotted
  off in the ordinary manner. Mr. Townsend states that there is no need to
  fear leaving the paper in the sensitive bath too long. He has left it in
  the bath fourteen hours without any injury. The paper thus prepared will
  keep ten or twelve days; it may be longer, but his experience does not
  extend beyond that time. With paper thus prepared a portrait was
  exhibited, taken in fifty-five seconds, in a room with a side light; but
  it must be added, that in this instance the paper was not washed, but was
  blotted off immediately on its leaving the sensitive bath, though not
  used until two hours had elapsed. Mr. Townsend uses for developing a
  saturated solution of gallic acid with a drachm of aceto-nitrate to every
  four ounces of it, but he considers that this proportion of aceto-nitrate
  may be beneficially lessened. He finds that by this process he is certain
  of success, and is never troubled with that browning over of the paper
  which so often attends the use of the other methods of preparation.
  Besides the rapidity of action which he states, there is the farther
  advantage that a lengthened exposure is not injurious. The proportion of
  bromide may vary from 150 grs. to 250 grs.; less than 150 is not
  sufficient to produce a maximum of rapidity, whilst more than 250 adds
  nothing to the effect.</p>

  <p><i>Photographic Litigation.</i>&mdash;Will you allow me, through the
  medium of "N. &amp; Q.," to suggest to those who <!-- Page 599 --><span
  class="pagenum" title="599.png"><a name="page599"></a>{599}</span>take an
  interest in the collodion process, the desirableness of making a
  subscription to aid Mr. Henderson in his defence against the proceedings
  commenced by Mr. Talbot, to restrain him (and through him, no doubt, all
  others) from taking collodion portraits.<a name="footnotetag11"
  href="#footnote11"><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It does not appear just that one person should bear the whole expense
  of a defence in which so many are interested; and I have no doubt that if
  a subscription be set on foot, many photographers will willingly
  contribute. A subscription, besides its material aid to Mr. Henderson,
  would also serve to show that public opinion is opposed to such absurd
  and unjust attempts at monopoly.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to imagine how a claim can be established to a right
  in an invention made many years subsequent to the date of the patent
  under which the claim is made&mdash;not only made by another person, but
  differing so widely in principle from the patent process. The
  advertisement in the <i>Athenæum</i> of Saturday last (June 10) shows
  plainly that it is intended, if possible, to prevent the production of
  portraits on collodion by any person not licensed by Mr. Talbot; and the
  harshness of this proceeding, after the process has been in public use
  for several years, needs no comment.</p>

<h2>Replies to Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Vandyking</i> (Vol. ix., p. 452.).&mdash;Your correspondent P. C.
  S. S. asks the meaning of the term <i>Vandyking</i>, in the following
  passage of a letter from Secretary Windebanke to the Lord Deputy
  Wentworth, dated Westminster, Nov. 20, 1633, the Lord Deputy being then
  in Ireland:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Now, my Lord, for my own observations of your carriage since you had
  the conduct of affairs there [in Ireland], because you press me so
  earnestly, I shall take the boldness to deliver myself as freely.</p>

  <p>"First, though while we had the happiness and honour to have your
  assistance here at the Council Board, you made many ill faces with your
  pen (pardon, I beseech your Lordship, the over free censure of your
  Vandyking), and worse, oftentimes, with your speeches, especially in the
  business of the Lord Falconberg, Sir Thomas Gore, Vermuyden, and others;
  yet I understand you make worse there in Ireland, and there never
  appeared a worse face under a cork upon a bottle, than your Lordship hath
  caused some to make in disgorging such church livings as their zeal had
  eaten up."&mdash;<i>Strafford's Letters</i>, vol. i. p. 161.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This passage, as well as what follows, is written in a strain of
  banter, and is intended to compliment the great Lord Deputy under the
  pretence of a free censure of his conduct. The first part of the second
  paragraph evidently alludes to Wentworth's habit of drawing faces upon
  paper when he was sitting at the Council Table, and the word
  <i>Vandyking</i> is used in the sense of <i>portrait-painting</i>.
  Vandyck was born in 1599; he visited England for a short time in 1620,
  and in 1632 he came to England permanently, was lodged by the king, and
  knighted; in the following year he received a pension of 200<i>l.</i> for
  life, and the title of painter to his Majesty. It was therefore quite
  natural that Windebanke should, in November, 1633, use the term
  <i>Vandyking</i> as equivalent to <i>portrait-painting</i>.</p>

  <p>In the latter part of the same paragraph, the allusion is to the wry
  faces, which the speeches of this imperious member of council sometimes
  caused. Can any of your correspondents explain the expression, "a worse
  face under a cork upon a bottle?"</p>

  <p><i>Monteith</i> (Vol. ix., p. 452.).&mdash;The Monteith was a kind of
  punch-bowl (sometimes of delf ware) with scallops or indentations in the
  brim, the object of which was to convert it into a convenient tray for
  bringing in the glasses. These were of wine-glass shape, and being placed
  with the brims downwards, and radiating from the centre, and with the
  handles protruding through the indentations in the bowl, were easily
  carried, without much jingling or risk of breakage. Of course the bowl
  was empty of liquor at the time.</p>

  <p class="author">P. P.</p>

  <p><i>A. M. and M. A.</i> (Vol. ix., p. 475.).&mdash;<span
  class="sc">Juverna</span>, M. A., is certainly wrong in stating that
  "Masters of Arts of Oxford are styled 'M. A.,' in contradistinction to
  the Masters of Arts in every other university." A. B., A. M., are the
  proper initials for <i>Baccalaureus</i> and <i>Magister Artium</i>, and
  should therefore only be used when the name is in Latin. B.A. and M.A.
  are those for Bachelor and Master of Arts, and are the only ones to be
  used where the name is expressed in English. Thus John Smith, had he
  taken his first degree in Arts at any university, might indicate the fact
  by signing John Smith, B.A., or Johannes S., A.B. If he put John Smith,
  A.B., a doubt might exist whether he were not an <i>able-bodied</i>
  seaman, for that is implied by A.B. attached to an English name. The
  editor of Farindon's <i>Sermons</i>, who is, I believe, a Dissenter,
  styles himself the Reverend T. Jackson, S.T.P., <i>i. e.</i> Sacrosanctæ
  Theologiæ <!-- Page 600 --><span class="pagenum" title="600.png"><a
  name="page600"></a>{600}</span>Professor. He might as well have part of
  his title in Sanscrit, as part in English and part in Latin.</p>

  <p>I believe this mistake is made more frequently by graduates of
  Cambridge than by those of Oxford. Indeed, they have now created a new
  degree, Master of Laws, with the initials LL.M. (Legum Magister). But
  they are usually infelicitous in their nomenclature, as witness their
  <i>voluntary</i> theological examination, now made <i>compulsory</i> by
  all the bishops.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The monks asserted that all heresies arose from those two languages

  upon our guard against it. As for Hebrew, my dear brethren, it is certain
  that all who learn it immediately become Jews.' Heresbach, a friend of
  Erasmus and a respectable author, reports these expressions."</p>

  <p>"These proceedings for the advancement of learning and knowledge,
  especially in divine matters, alarmed the ignorant and illiterate monks,
  insomuch that they declaimed from the pulpits, that 'there was now a
  <i>new language</i> discovered called Greek, of which people should
  beware, since it was that which produced all the heresies; that in this
  language was come forth a book called the <i>New Testament</i>, which was
  now in everybody's hands, and was full of thorns and briers: that there
  was also another language now started up which they called Hebrew, and
  that they who learnt it were termed Hebrews.'"</p>

  <p><i>Caldecott's Translation of the New Testament</i> (Vol. viii., p.
  410.).&mdash;J. M. Caldecott, the translator of the New Testament,
  referred to by your correspondent S. A. S., is the son of the late
  &mdash;&mdash; Caldecott, Esq., of Rugby Lodge, and was educated at Rugby
  School, where I believe he obtained one or more prizes as a first-class
  Greek and Hebrew scholar. After completing his studies at this school,
  his father purchased for him a commission in the East India Company's
  service; but soon after his arrival in India, conceiving a dislike to the
  army, he sold his commission and returned to England. Being somewhat
  singular in his notions, and altogether eccentric both in manner and
  appearance, he estranged himself from his family and friends, and, as I
  have been informed, took up his temporary abode in this city about the
  year 1828. Although his income was at that time little short of
  300<i>l.</i> per annum, he had neither house nor servant of his own; but
  boarded in the house of a respectable tradesman, living on the plainest
  fare (so as he was wont to say), to enable him to give the more to feed
  the hungry and clothe the naked. In this way, and by being frequently
  imposed upon by worthless characters, he gave away, in a few years,
  nearly all his property, leaving himself almost destitute: and, indeed,
  would have been entirely so, but for a weekly allowance made to him by
  his mother (sometime since deceased), on which he is at the present time
  living in great obscurity in one of our large seaport towns; but may be
  occasionally seen in the streets with a long beard, and a broad-brimmed
  hat, addressing a group of idlers and half-naked children. I could
  furnish your correspondent S. A. S. with more information if needful.</p>

  <p>"<i>Putting a spoke in his wheel</i>" (Vol. viii., pp. 269. 351.
  576.).&mdash;There is no doubt that "putting a spoke in his wheel" is
  "offering an obstruction." But I have always understood the "spoke" to
  be, not a radius of the wheel, but a bar put between the spokes at right
  angles, so as to prevent the turning of the wheel; a rude mode of
  "locking," which I have often seen practised. The correctness of the
  metaphor is thus evident.</p>

  <p><i>Right of redeeming Property</i> (Vol. viii., p. 516.).&mdash;This
  right formerly existed in Normandy, and, I believe, in other parts of
  France. In the bailiwick of Guernsey, the laws of which are based on the
  ancient custom of Normandy, the right is still exercised, although it has
  been abolished for some years in the neighbouring island of Jersey. <!--
  Page 602 --><span class="pagenum" title="602.png"><a
  name="page602"></a>{602}</span></p>

  <p>The law only applies to real property, which, by the Norman custom,
  was divided in certain proportions among all the children; and this right
  of "retrait," as it is technically termed, was doubtless intended to
  counteract in some measure the too minute division of land, and to
  preserve inheritances in families. It must be exercised within a year of
  the purchase. For farther information on the subject, Berry's <i>History
  of Guernsey</i>, p. 176., may be consulted.</p>

  <p><i>Latin Inscription on Lindsey Court-house</i> (Vol. ix., pp. 492.
  552.).&mdash;I cannot but express my surprise at the learned (?) trifling
  of some of your correspondents on the inscription upon Lindsey
  Court-house. Try it thus:</p>

<p class="ac">
 "Fiat Justitia,<br />
1619,<br />
Hæc domus<br />
<i>O</i>dit, amat, punit, conservat, honorat,<br />
<i>N</i>equitiam, pacem, crimina, jura, bonos."
</p>

  <p>which will make two lines, an hexameter and a pentameter, the first
  letters, <i>O</i> and <i>N</i>, having perhaps been effaced by time or
  accident.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Neglectus.</span></p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[That this emendation is the right one is clear from the communication
  of another correspondent, B. R. A. Y., who makes the same, and adds in
  confirmation, "The following lines existed formerly (and do, perhaps,
  now) on the Market-house at Much Wenlock, Shropshire, which will explain
  their meaning:</p>

<p class="ac">
'Hic locus<br />
<i>O</i>dit, amat, punit, conservat, honorat,<br />
<i>N</i>equitiam, pacem, crimina, jura, bonos.'
</p>

  <p>The <i>O</i> and <i>N</i>, being at the beginning of the lines as
  given by your correspondent, were doubtless obliterated by age."]</p>

</div>

  <p>The restoration of this inscription proposed by me is erroneous, and
  must be corrected from the perfect inscription as preserved at Pistoia
  and Much Wenlock, cited by another correspondent in p. 552. The three
  inscriptions are slightly varied. Perhaps "amat pacem" is better than
  "amat leges," on account of the tautology with "conservat jura."</p>

  <p class="author">L.</p>

  <p><i>Myrtle Bee</i> (Vol. ix., p. 205. &amp;c.).&mdash;"I have carefully
  read and reread the articles on the myrtle bee, and I can come to no
  other conclusion than that it is not a bird at all, but an insect, one of
  the hawkmoths, and probably the humming-bird hawkmoth. We have so many
  indefatigable genuine <i>field naturalists</i>, picking up every
  straggler which is blown to our coasts, that I cannot think it possible
  there is a bird at all common to <i>any</i> district of England, and yet
  totally unknown to science. Now, insects are often exceedingly abundant
  in particular localities, yet scarcely known beyond them. The <i>size</i>
  <span class="sc">C. Brown</span> describes as certainly not larger than
  <i>half</i> that of the common wren. The humming-bird (<i>H. M.</i>) is
  scarcely so large as this, but its vibratory motion would make it look
  somewhat larger than it really is. Its breadth, from tip to tip of the
  wings, is twenty to twenty-four lines. The myrtle bee's "short flight is
  rapid, steady, and direct," exactly that of the hawkmoth. The tongue of
  the myrtle bee is "round, sharp, and pointed at the end, appearing
  capable of penetration," not a bad <i>popular</i> description of the
  suctorial trunk of the hawkmoth, from which it gains its generic name,
  <i>Macroglossa</i>. Its second pair of wings are of a rusty yellow
  colour, which, when closed, would give it it the appearance of being
  "tinged with yellow about the vent." It has also a tuft of scaly hairs at
  the extremity of the abdomen, which would suggest the idea of a tail. In
  fact, on the wing, it appears very like a little bird, as attested by its
  common name. In habit it generally retires from the mid-day sun, which
  would account for its being "put up" by the dogs. The furze-chat,
  mentioned by <span class="sc">C. Brown</span>, is the <i>Saxicola
  rubetra</i>, commonly also called the whinchat.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Wm. Hazel.</span></p>

  <p><i>Mousehunt</i> (Vol. ix., p. 65. &amp;c.).&mdash;<span class="sc">G.
  Tennyson</span> identifies the mousehunt with the beechmartin, the
  <i>very largest</i> of our <i>Mustelidæ</i>, on the authority of Henley
  "the dramatic commentator." Was he a naturalist too? I never heard of him
  as such.</p>

  <p>Now, <span class="sc">Mr. W. R. D. Salmon</span>, who first asked the
  question, speaks of it as <i>less</i> than the common weasel, and quotes
  Mr. Colquhoun's opinion, that it is only "the young of the year." I have
  no doubt at all that this is correct. The young of all the
  <i>Mustelidæ</i> hunt, and to a casual observer exhibit all the actions
  of full-grown animals, when not more than half the size of their parents.
  There seems no reason to suppose that there are more than four species
  known in England, the weasel, the stoat or ermine, the polecat, and the
  martin. The full-grown female of the weasel is much smaller than the
  male. Go to any zealous gamekeeper's exhibition, and you will see them of
  many gradations in size.</p>

  <p><i>Longfellow's "Hyperion"</i> (Vol. ix., p. 495.).&mdash;I would
  offer the following rather as a suggestion than as an answer to <span
  class="sc">Mordan Gillott</span>. But it has always appeared to me that
  Longfellow has himself explained, by a simple allusion in the work, the
  <i>reason</i> which dictated the name of his <i>Hyperion</i>. As the
  ancients fabled Hyperion to be the offspring of the heavens and the
  earth; so, in his aspirations, and his weakness and sorrows, Flemming
  (the hero of the work) personifies, as it were, the mingling of heaven
  and earth in the heart and <!-- Page 603 --><span class="pagenum" title="603.png"
  ><a name="page603"></a>{603}</span>mind of a man of true nobility. The
  passage to which I allude is the following:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Noble examples of a high purpose, and a fixed will! Do they not move,
  Hyperion-like, on high? Were they not likewise sons of heaven and
  earth?"&mdash;Book iv. ch. 1.</p>

  <p><i>Benjamin Rush</i> (Vol. ix., p. 451.).&mdash;<span
  class="sc">Inquirer</span> asks "Why the freedom of Edinburgh was
  conferred upon him?" I have looked into the Records of the Town Council,
  and found the following entry:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"4th March, 1767. The Council admit and receive Richard Stocktoun,
  Esquire, of New Jersey, Councillour at Law, and Benjamin Rush, Esquire,
